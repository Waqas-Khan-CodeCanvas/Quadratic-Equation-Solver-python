## ▶️ Quadratic Equation Solver  

A Python program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. It determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex) based on the discriminant.  

### 📌 Features  
- Solves quadratic equations of the form **ax² + bx + c = 0**.  
- Computes and displays both roots of the equation.  
- Determines the type of roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).  
- Uses the **cmath** module to handle complex roots.  

### 🚀 How to Run  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quadratic-Equation-Solver.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**  
   ```bash
   cd Quadratic-Equation-Solver
   ```
3. **Run the script**  
   ```bash
   python quadratic_solver.py
   ```

### 📝 Example Output  
```
General Form :-  ax² + bx + c = 0
Enter a (a!=0): 1
Enter b: -3
Enter c: 2

Result for equation, 1x² - 3x + 2 = 0 are:-
Type of root: Two distinct real roots
The solutions are (1+0j) and (2+0j)
